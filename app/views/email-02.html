      <p>
      Your signed framework agreement will be sent to the Crown Commercial Service to be countersigned.
      </p>

      <p>
      We'll email you when the countersigned agreement is available.
      </p>

      <p>
      You'll need to wait for CCS to countersign your agreement before you can sell services.
